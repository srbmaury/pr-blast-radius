## Repository/service catalog

Repository ownership is stored explicitly in product metadata:

```text
acme/orders -> orders-service
acme/payments -> payment-service
```

PR analysis resolves the runtime service from the catalog automatically.

An explicit `?service=` parameter has higher precedence and can be used for temporary or canary mappings.

## Database isolation

Customer PostgreSQL is evidence-only.

Product-owned metadata lives in the separate metadata datasource:

- runtime dependency edges
- repository/service mappings
- future product configuration

## Runtime edge persistence

Each edge stores source service, target service, observed call count, and last-seen timestamp.

Stale edges are deleted according to the configured retention window.

## Evidence model

Only observed SQL or runtime edges become `CONFIRMED` findings. Missing telemetry remains missing evidence rather than guessed topology.

## Next focused capability

Add repository bootstrap/discovery so a new installation can populate service mappings from configuration or repository metadata without manually calling the catalog API one repository at a time.
